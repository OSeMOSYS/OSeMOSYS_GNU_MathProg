# OSeMOSYS Change Log

### Change of ReserveMargin Calculation
The ReserveMargin has so far been calculated in relation to the TimeSlice with the highest demand. 
However, often the time slices in OSeMOSYS models do not represent exactly one hour. Therefore this approach
does not reflect the estimation of real world ReserveMargin calculation. 
This commit changes the way the ReserveMargin in OSeMOSYS is being calculated. 
By introducing the new parameter AnnualPeakHour the modeller needs to enter the demand of the hour with the 
highest demand, if one wishes to have a ReserveMargin. Since one commonly has hourly demand data available 
when modelling, determining the hour with the highest demand is not creating significatn additional work. 
In the different code versions the following modifications have been made:
**long**
- added: 
	param AnnualPeakHour{r in REGION, y in YEAR}
- modified: 
	RM1_ReserveMargin_TechnologiesIncluded_In_Activity_Units,
	RM3_RM3_ReserveMargin_Constraint
- taken out: 
	RM2_ReserveMargin_FuelsIncluded
**short**
- added: 
	param AnnualPeakHour{r in REGION, y in YEAR}
- modified:
	RM3_RM3_ReserveMargin_Constraint
**fast**
- added: 
	param AnnualPeakHour{r in REGION, y in YEAR}
- modified:
	RM3_RM3_ReserveMargin_Constraint

## Version 1.0.0

This is the first stable version of OSeMOSYS to be reduced using the Semantic Versioning pattern
of numbering. You can read more about semver [here](https://semver.org/).

### Multiple alternative versions of OSeMOSYS

Three implementations of OSeMOSYS nicknamed the **long**, the **short** and **fast** versions
of the code are included. All three take the same input parameters, and produce the same
set of results.

The **long** version is best for teaching, learning and developing extensions to the code.
The formulation almost exactly matches the original description of the mathematical formulation
in the 2011 paper.

The **short** version is best for stable and accelerated performance. It reduces the size of the
matrix produced through removing intermediate decision variables and combining equations. 
The resultant increase in performance comes at the cost of reduced ease of debugging. 
However, this allows larger models to be solved, and reduces solution time.

The **fast** is highest performance, but very terse and uses a number of more complicated tricks to
reduce the size of the matrix and thus increase performance. The fast version is not yet fully
tested and should be considered experimental.

### Numerous smaller performance improvements

A number of small performance improvements have been included, reducing the problem size by
implementing conditional operators.

### Reintroduced technology specific discount rate

The `DiscountRate` parameter has been replaced with one containing a technology index 
`DiscountRate[r,t]` and a new parameter for storage has been added `DiscountRateStorage[r,s]`.

### OSeMOSYS checks for basic errors in input data

- Thanks to @vignesh1987 for providing check statements for 
    - `Capacity investment`
    - `Annual Activity`
    - `Total capacity`
    - `Minimum Annual activity`
    - `Time Slice`
    - `Model period activity limit`

These raise an error if incompatible or incorrect data is presented to the 
model prior to attempting a solve step. This saves time, and avoids many
infeasible solutions due to data errors.

### Folder of CSV result parameters added

- Results parameters are written out into individual CSV files in long format.
- Headers correspond to the index of the variable, e.g. `REGION,FUEL,VALUE`

### Adds ResultPath parameter to choose location of results

Data files should now include a `ResultPath` parameter to choose the location of the results

### Conditional operators added to 6 parameters

Pull request #30 @tniet, @willu47

Conditional operators were added to five parameters in both short and long versions of the code:

- `TotalAnnualMaxCapacity`
- `TotalAnnualMaxCapacityInvestment`
- `TotalTechnologyAnnualActivityUpperLimit`
- `AnnualEmissionLimit`
- `ModelPeriodEmissionLimit`
- `TotalTechnologyModelPeriodActivityUpperLimit`

If the default value in the corresponding data file is set of `-1`, then the constraints will no longer be generated,
resulting in a significant improvement in the size of the problem created, and avoiding issues where some constraints
were ignored.

## Model osemosys_short.txt with commit hash 7548c08

Modified by Kevin Palmer-Wilson

### Changes with respect to previous version commit hash 14cd8cc:

#### Changes in model file

- Modified objective function to avoid double counting of CapitalCostStorage: The `sum{s in STORAGE}` was inside the `sum{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, y in YEAR}`. Therefore, the storage costs were multiplied by the number of regions times the number of technologies times the number of years. In the corrected version the accounting for storage costs has been moved outside of the `sum{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, y in YEAR}` such that `sum{r in REGION, s in STORAGE, y in YEAR}` are added separately only once.

##### Previous equation

```
minimize cost: sum{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, y in YEAR} (((((sum{yy in YEAR: y-yy < OperationalLife[r,t] && y-yy>=0} NewCapacity[r,t,yy])+ ResidualCapacity[r,t,y])*FixedCost[r,t,y] + sum{m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, l in TIMESLICE} RateOfActivity[r,l,t,m,y]*YearSplit[l,y]*VariableCost[r,t,m,y])/((1+DiscountRate[r])^(y-min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)+0.5))+CapitalCost[r,t,y] * NewCapacity[r,t,y]/((1+DiscountRate[r])^(y-min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)))+DiscountedTechnologyEmissionsPenalty[r,t,y]-DiscountedSalvageValue[r,t,y]) + sum{s in STORAGE} (CapitalCostStorage[r,s,y] * NewStorageCapacity[r,s,y]/((1+DiscountRate[r])^(y-min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)))-SalvageValueStorage[r,s,y]/((1+DiscountRate[r])^(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)-min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)+1))));
```

##### New equation

```

## 1.	Model 2017_11_08 and Model 2017_11_08_short

Modified by Francesco Gardumi

### Changes with respect to previous version OSeMOSYS_2016_08_01:

- Modified equation `E1_AnnualEmissionProductionByMode: technologies` with `EmissionActivityRatio = 0` would ignore the equation, due to the statement `EmissionActivityRatio <>0`, giving rise to unsound results in cases where negative emissions are allowed. The statement was therefore removed.

#### Changes in model file

##### Previous equation

```
s.t. E1_AnnualEmissionProductionByMode{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, e in EMISSION, m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, y in YEAR: EmissionActivityRatio[r,t,e,m,y]<>0}: EmissionActivityRatio[r,t,e,m,y]*TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[r,t,m,y]=AnnualTechnologyEmissionByMode[r,t,e,m,y];
```

##### New equation

```
s.t. E1_AnnualEmissionProductionByMode{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, e in EMISSION, m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, y in YEAR}: EmissionActivityRatio[r,t,e,m,y]*TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[r,t,m,y]=AnnualTechnologyEmissionByMode[r,t,e,m,y];
```

### Changes with respect to previous version OSeMOSYS_2016_08_01_short:

- Modified equations `E5_DiscountedEmissionsPenaltyByTechnology`, `E8_AnnualEmissionsLimit` and `E9_ModelPeriodEmissionsLimit`: the statement `EmissionActivityRatio <>0` was removed, in line with the corresponding modification to OSeMOSYS_2016_08_01 (see above).
- Fixed bug in the objective function.
- Fixed bug in the storage constraints `SC2_LowerLimit_EndOfDailyTimeBracketOfLastInstanceOfDayTypeInFirstWeekConstraint` and `SC2_UpperLimit_EndOfDailyTimeBracketOfLastInstanceOfDayTypeInFirstWeekConstraint`.
- Fixed bug in the minimum renewable target constraint `RE4_EnergyConstraint`.

## 2.	Model 2016_08_01 and Model 2016_08_01_short

Modified by Francesco Gardumi

Main changes to previous version OSeMOSYS_2015_08_27 and OSeMOSYS_2015_08_27_short

- Fixed bugs in the Storage Equations and Storage Constraints of OSeMOSYS_2015_08_27_short.
- Parameter REMinProductionTarget is no more indicated by the user as a percentage of the demand for a given fuel f, but as a percentage of the production of a given fuel f. With the previous formulation the target could be put only on fuels for which SpecifiedAnnualDemand is indicated. The current formulation is more general and it allows the target to be put not only on fuels for final consumption, but also on intermediate fuels. This necessity arose in some cases.

## 3.	Model 2015_08_27 and Model 2015_08_27_short
Modified by Abhishek Shivakumar and Manuel Welsch

Main changes to previous version OSeMOSYS_2013_05_10 and OSeMOSYS_2013_05_10_short
- Removed the parameter TechWithCapacityNeededToMeetPeakTS from constraint CAa4_Constraint_Capacity. This parameter caused CapacityFactor values to be ignored when the user did not set TechWithCapacityNeededToMeetPeakTS to a non-zero value. The removal of this parameter helps users avoid committing this error. TechWithCapacityNeededToMeetPeakTS was used only once in the entire model and its removal does not affect the results-writing section of the code
- Fixed a bug related to using CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit in constraint CAa5_TotalNewCapacity. The new fix allows the model to correctly employ a constraint on the capacity of individual technology units (which the model optimises using mixed integer programming (MIP))
- Fixed a bug in the storage equations which caused an error if more than one day type was used
- DiscountRate is no longer technology-specific. Therefore, DiscountRateStorage is now replaced by DiscountRate. In most OSeMOSYS models a single DiscountRate value is applied for all technologies, since data on financing levels for different technologies in different countries/regions is often lacking, a common region-specific (without including technology-specificity) DiscountRate is deemed to be sufficient.

### 4.	Model 2013_05_10_short
Modified by Abhishek Shivakumar and Manuel Welsch

Main changes to previous version OSeMOSYS_2013_05_10
- Significantly reduced the total number of equations by integrating them into the existing inequalities. This eliminates the need to calculate and store intermediate values.
The reduction in the number of equations translates into the generation of a smaller matrix to be solved. This significantly reduces the memory usage (~10x) and the processing time (~5x).
This version of the OSeMOSYS code contains only the essential equations required for running the model. However, all the previous equations have been left as before, and "commented out" to better understand the methodology followed to shorten the code.

It is important to note that the shortening of the code does not change any aspect of the functionality of OSeMOSYS. Furthermore, there are no special formatting requirements of data file required to run this version instead of the regular version. The short version of OSeMOSYS only serves to reduce the memory usage as well as the processing time for finding the model solution. In the future, both the regular and the short versions of OSeMOSYS will be developed and released simultaneously.

### 5.	Model 2013_05_10
Modified by Abhishek Shivakumar and Manuel Welsch

#### Main changes to previous version OSeMOSYS_2013_04_30

Re-ordered the arguments of parameters, variables and constraints to be compatible for use with the ANSWER interface which is currently being developed by Noble-Soft Systems Pty Ltd.

Henceforth, this reordered indexing will be applied to all future versions of the OSeMOSYS model.

Example
`{y in YEAR, l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, f in FUEL, r in REGION}` is now
`{r in REGION, l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, f in FUEL, y in YEAR}`

Following the above index order
`RateOfProductionByTechnologyByMode[y,l,t,m,f,r]` is now `RateOfProductionByTechnologyByMode[r,l,t,m,f,y]`

### 6.	Model 2013_04_30
Modified by Manuel Welsch

A bug was fixed which occurred if concrete blocks of capacity were to be considered, i.e., if the parameter CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit was chosen to be unequal to zero. In this case the NewCapacity variable was left undefined. The derived variable CapitalInvestment was therefore not calculated correctly.

##### Previous equation
```
s.t. CAa1_TotalNewCapacity{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}:
AccumulatedNewCapacity[y,t,r]  =  sum{yy in YEAR: y-yy < OperationalLife[t,r] && y-yy>=0}  if CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[y,t,r]=0 then NewCapacity[yy,t,r]  else CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[yy,t,r]*NumberOfNewTechnologyUnits[yy,t,r];
 ```

##### New equations
```
s.t. CAa1_TotalNewCapacity{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, y in YEAR}:
AccumulatedNewCapacity[y,t,r] = sum{yy in YEAR: y-yy < OperationalLife[t,r] && y-yy>=0}
NewCapacity[yy,t,r];

s.t. CAa5_TotalNewCapacity{r in REGION, t in TECHNOLOGY, y in YEAR:
CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[y,t,r]<>0}:
CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[y,t,r]*NumberOfNewTechnologyUnits[y,t,r] = NewCapacity[y,t,r];
```

### 7.	Model 2013_03_14
Modified by Manuel Welsch

Main changes to previous version OSeMOSYS_2012_06_01_BETA

- Introduced the option to choose between sinking fund and straight line depreciation
- Removed parameter SalvageFactor, which was not used by the model
- Fixed a bug in the storage equations which caused an error if more than one day type was used
- Included table statements in the model file, immediately before the objective function and after the solve statement.

This was done to demonstrate how parameters can be imported and exported. The table statements are commented out, and just serve as examples.

#### Option to choose the depreciation method
The previously used sinking fund depreciation results in a high “residual value” if a technology is invested in closely before the end of the modelling period. This might make investments in more capital intensive technologies with lower running costs more attractive. If this effect should be avoided, the analyst now has the option to choose between sinking fund and straight line depreciation. This is done by setting the new parameter `DepreciationMethod` equal to `1` in order to use the straight line depreciation, or equal to `2` for straight line depreciation.

#### Changes in the model file
The following equations were removed:
```
s.t. SI7_SalvageValueStorageAtEndOfPeriod2{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION:
(y+OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) && DiscountRateStorage[s,r]=0}:
CapitalInvestmentStorage[s,y,r]*(1-(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)/OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]) =
SalvageValueStorage[s,y,r];

s.t. SI8_SalvageValueStorageAtEndOfPeriod3{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION:
(y+OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) && DiscountRateStorage[s,r]>0}:
CapitalInvestmentStorage[s,y,r]*(1-(((1+DiscountRateStorage[s,r])^(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)1)/((1+DiscountRateStorage[s,r])^OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1))) = SalvageValueStorage[s,y,r];

s.t. SV1_SalvageValueAtEndOfPeriod1{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION: (y +
OperationalLife[t,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) && DiscountRate[t,r]>0}: SalvageValue[y,t,r] =
CapitalCost[y,t,r]*NewCapacity[y,t,r]*(1-(((1+DiscountRate[t,r])^(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)-
1)/((1+DiscountRate[t,r])^OperationalLife[t,r]-1)));

s.t. SV2_SalvageValueAtEndOfPeriod2{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION: (y +
OperationalLife[t,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) && DiscountRate[t,r]=0}: SalvageValue[y,t,r] =
CapitalCost[y,t,r]*NewCapacity[y,t,r]*(1-(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)/OperationalLife[t,r]);
```
The following equations were added:
The following equation only applies if the sinking fund depreciation is chosen and if the discount rate is larger than zero:
```
s.t. SI7_SalvageValueStorageAtEndOfPeriod2{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION:
(DepreciationMethod[r]=1 && (y+OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) &&
DiscountRateStorage[s,r]=0) || (DepreciationMethod[r]=2 && (y+OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)))}: CapitalInvestmentStorage[s,y,r]*(1-(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)/OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]) = SalvageValueStorage[s,y,r];
```
The following equation will be used if the straight line depreciation will be chosen, or if the sinking fund depreciation will be chosen and the discount rate equals zero:
```
s.t. SI8_SalvageValueStorageAtEndOfPeriod3{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION:
DepreciationMethod[r]=1 && (y+OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) &&
DiscountRateStorage[s,r]>0}: CapitalInvestmentStorage[s,y,r]*(1(((1+DiscountRateStorage[s,r])^(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)-
1)/((1+DiscountRateStorage[s,r])^OperationalLifeStorage[s,r]-1))) = SalvageValueStorage[s,y,r];
```

The following equation only applies if the sinking fund depreciation is chosen and if the discount rate is larger than zero:
```
s.t. SV1_SalvageValueAtEndOfPeriod1{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION:
DepreciationMethod[r]=1 && (y + OperationalLife[t,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) &&
DiscountRate[t,r]>0}: SalvageValue[y,t,r] = CapitalCost[y,t,r]*NewCapacity[y,t,r]*(1-
(((1+DiscountRate[t,r])^(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)-
1)/((1+DiscountRate[t,r])^OperationalLife[t,r]-1)));
```

The following equation will be used if the straight line depreciation will be chosen, or if the sinking fund depreciation will be chosen and the discount rate equals zero:
```
s.t. SV2_SalvageValueAtEndOfPeriod2{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION:
(DepreciationMethod[r]=1 && (y + OperationalLife[t,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)) &&
DiscountRate[t,r]=0) || (DepreciationMethod[r]=2 && (y + OperationalLife[t,r]-1) > (max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)))}: SalvageValue[y,t,r] = CapitalCost[y,t,r]*NewCapacity[y,t,r]*(1-(max{yy in YEAR} max(yy) - y+1)/OperationalLife[t,r]);
 ```

#### Changes in the data file
The parameter DepreciationMethod has to be defined in the data file. It equals to 1 for the sinking fund and 2 for the straight line depreciation, e.g.,
```
param DepreciationMethod default 1 :=;
```

DAILYTIMEBRACKET:lh-lhlh<0} NetChargeWithinDay[s,y,ls,ld-1,lhlh,r])-StorageUpperLimit[s,y,r] <= 0;
```

### 8.	Model 2012_06_01_BETA
Modified by Manuel Welsch

#### Trade between regions
Users requested an addition of a trade functionality between regions. This is done defining trade links between regions and adding the trade to the energy balance. If investments in, e.g., transmission capacity and losses should be modeled, a technology could be defined accordingly in one region which produces a fuel which is specifically intended for trade to another region.

##### Changes in model file

- Addition of new parameter to define the trade links between different regions: `param TradeRoute{y in YEAR, f in FUEL, r in REGION, rr in REGION};`
- Addition of new variables to calculate the actual trade from a `region r` to a `region rr`: `var Trade{y in YEAR, l in TIMESLICE, f in FUEL, r in REGION, rr in REGION}; var TradeAnnual{y in YEAR, f in FUEL, r in REGION, rr in REGION};`
- Added a new constraint EBa10, which ensures that whatever is exported from a region r to a region rr is as well imported from the region rr to the region r: `s.t. EBa10_EnergyBalanceEachTS4{y in YEAR,l in TIMESLICE, f in FUEL, r in REGION, rr in REGION}: Trade[y,l,f,r,rr] = -Trade[y,l,f,rr,r];`
- Renamed the previous constraint EBa10 to EBa11 and added the sum of the exports from a region r to all other regions rr to which export links exist: `s.t. EBa11_EnergyBalanceEachTS5{y in YEAR,l in TIMESLICE, f in FUEL, r in REGION}: Production[y,l,f,r] >= Demand[y,l,f,r] + Use[y,l,f,r] + sum{rr in REGION} Trade[y,l,f,r,rr]*TradeRoute[y,f,r,rr];`
- Added a new constraint EBb3 to calculate the annual trade: `s.t. EBb3_EnergyBalanceEachYear3{y in YEAR, f in FUEL, r in REGION, rr in REGION}: sum{l in TIMESLICE} Trade[y,l,f,r,rr] = TradeAnnual[y,f,r,rr];`
- Renamed the previous constraint EBb3 to EBb4 and added the sum of the annual exports from a region r to all other regions rr to which export links exist: `s.t. EBb4_EnergyBalanceEachYear4{y in YEAR, f in FUEL, r in REGION}: ProductionAnnual[y,f,r] >= UseAnnual[y,f,r] + sum{rr in REGION}  TradeAnnual[y,f,r,rr] *TradeRoute[y,f,r,rr]  + AccumulatedAnnualDemand[y,f,r];`

##### Changes in data file:
- The parameter TradeRoute will need to be defined. If everything should remain as it was previously, i.e., if no trade should be considered, the parameter should simply be set to zero: `param TradeRoute default 0 := ;`

##### Introduction of technology additions in predefined blocks of capacity
Until now, OSeMOSYS was calculating the addition of technologies without any possibility to predefine the size of the capacities which could be added. For example, OSeMOSYS may have calculated that it would be optimal to add 0.7 MW of coal-fired power plants in 2020, despite the unrealistically small size of such a unit. While this has significant advantages with regard to the computational power required to solve the model, we now have introduced mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to enable more realistic assessments. The user may now decide whether a faster but less accurate model run without MILP is preferred, or if the possibility to capture realistic power plant or technology additions justifies a more intense effort.

##### Changes in model file:
- Addition of new parameter to define the minimum size of one capacity addition:
`param CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION};`
- Addition of a new variable to calculate the number of units to be added:
`var NumberOfNewTechnologyUnits{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION} >= 0,integer;`
- Changes in the constraint CAa1 to ensure the previous method without MILP is used if no minimum size of one capacity addition is defined (i.e., if CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit has a value of zero), and to change to MILP otherwise: ```s.t. CAa1_TotalNewCapacity{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}:
AccumulatedNewCapacity[y,t,r] = sum{yy in YEAR: y-yy < OperationalLife[t,r] && y-yy>=0}  if CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[y,t,r]=0 then NewCapacity[yy,t,r]
else CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit[yy,t,r]*NumberOfNewTechnologyUnits[yy,t,r];```

##### Changes in data file:
- The parameter CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit will need to be defined. If everything should remain as it was previously, i.e., if no MILP should be used, the parameter should simply be set to zero: param CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit default 0 := ;

#### Variability in generation
In order to introduce the modelling of variable electricity generation, the dimensions of the capacity factor are extended to include time slices in addition to years. This requires changing the parameter definition and the equations CAa4 and CAb1.
For a more detailed explanation refer to the following working paper at desa.kth.se: Manuel Welsch, Mark Howells, Morgan Bazilian, Joseph DeCarolis, Sebastian Hermann, Hans-Holger Rogner. 2012. Modelling Selected Attributes of Smart Grids - A Contribution to Open Source Energy Systems Analysis.

##### Changes in model file:
- `param CapacityFactor{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, l in TIMESLICE, r in REGION};`
- `s.t. CAa4_Constraint_Capacity{y in YEAR, l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION: TechWithCapacityNeededToMeetPeakTS[t,r]<>0}: RateOfTotalActivity[y,l,t,r] <= TotalCapacityAnnual[y,t,r] * CapacityFactor[y,t,l,r]*CapacityToActivityUnit[t,r];`
- `s.t. CAb1_PlannedMaintenance{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}: sum{l in TIMESLICE} RateOfTotalActivity[y,l,t,r]*YearSplit[y,l] <= sum{l in TIMESLICE} (TotalCapacityAnnual[y,t,r]*CapacityFactor[y,t,l,r]*YearSplit[y,l])*AvailabilityFactor[y,t,r]*CapacityToActivityUnit[t,r];`

##### Changes in data file:
- Due to the additional dimension of the CapacityFactor, the parameter will have to be redefined accordingly. Refer to the parameter definition within the UTOPIA application for guidance.

#### Storage
Until previously, it was only possible to model storage in a basic fashion: Times within a year where extreme storage level were expected to occur had to be entered manually be the analyst. Similarly, storage capacities were exogenously defined and not optimised. A more sophisticated approach is therefore introduced, based on a sequential analysis of extreme storage levels throughout the year.  If existing storage boundaries don’t suffice, the model will investigate if new storage capacities should be added at a given cost of investment per unit of energy stored.

For a more detailed explanation of the concept and the required modifications in the model refer to the following working paper at desa.kth.se: Manuel Welsch, Mark Howells, Morgan Bazilian, Joseph DeCarolis, Sebastian Hermann, Hans-Holger Rogner. 2012. Modelling Selected Attributes of Smart Grids - A Contribution to Open Source Energy Systems Analysis.

Changes in data file:
- The following set is not required any longer: `BOUNDARY_INSTANCES`;
- The following sets need to be added:
-	`set SEASON;`
-	`set DAYTYPE;`
-	`set DAILYTIMEBRACKET;`
- The following parameters are not required any longer:
-	`param StorageInflectionTimes{y in YEAR, l in TIMESLICE, b in BOUNDARY_INSTANCES};`
-	`param StorageUpperLimit{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`
-	`param StorageLowerLimit{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`
- The following parameters need to be defined:
-	`param Conversionls{ls in SEASON, l in TIMESLICE};`
-	`param Conversionld{ld in DAYTYPE, l in TIMESLICE};`
-	`param Conversionlh{lh in DAILYTIMEBRACKET, l in TIMESLICE}; `
-	`param DaySplit{y in YEAR, lh in DAILYTIMEBRACKET};`
-	`param DaysInDayType{y in YEAR, ls in SEASON, ld in DAYTYPE}; `
-	`param StorageLevelStart{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`
-	`param StorageMaxChargeRate{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`
-	`param StorageMaxDischargeRate{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`

-	`param CapitalCostStorage{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION};`
-	`param DiscountRateStorage{s in STORAGE, r in REGION};`
-	`param ResidualStorageCapacity{s in STORAGE, y in YEAR, r in REGION};`
Other changes:
- The following constraints will now only be used if the `OutputActivityRatio[y,t,f,m,r]` or the `InputActivityRatio[y,t,f,m,r]<>0` in order to reduce the matrix size when solving the optimisation problem:
-	`EBa1_RateOfFuelProduction1`
-	`EBa2_RateOfFuelProduction2`
-	`EBa4_RateOfFuelUse1`
-	`EBa5_RateOfFuelUse2`
- In the following constraints, the limitation of the validity of the equation for upper parameter values < 9999 was removed:
-	`TCC1_TotalAnnualMaxCapacityConstraint`
-	`NCC1_TotalAnnualMaxNewCapacityConstraint`
-	`AAC2_TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityUpperLimit`
-	`TAC2_TotalModelHorizonTechnologyActivityUpperLimit`
- Changed model file extension to .mod and data file extension of the UTOPIA application to .dat to ensure a better integration within GUSEK (http://gusek.sourceforge.net/gusek.html), an integrated development environment (IDE) for the glpk solver.
- Deleted the variable definition of `TotalGenerationByRETechnologies`, as it is not used in the model.

Reasons for the change

```
Reasons for the change
SV1-4: The Card expression yielded a number +1 higher than was required. StartYear + card(YEAR), for example would give the ‘end year + 1’; 1 is subtracted from OperationalLife, as new technology is already available at beginning of year;
SV1-4: Using “max{yy in YEAR} max(yy)” and “min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)” removes the need to include the parameter ‘StartYear’ in these equations.
SV2: allows a discount rate of 0

##### Previous equations:

DiscountedOperatingCost[y,t,r];
```
Reasons for the change

`OC4 min{yy in YEAR} min(yy)` removes the need to include the parameter `StartYear`

Notes
The parameter `StartYear` can now be removed from the data file. But keeping it there does not affect the results. To do:
-	Update UTOPIA example (take out StartYear)
-	Update the parameter description
-	Update the UTOPIA example and documentation

Previous first printf statement: `printf "\n" >> "SelectedResults.csv";`
New first printf statement: `printf "\n" > "SelectedResults.csv";`
Reasons for the change:

```
s.t. OC1_OperatingCostsVariable{y in YEAR,l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in
REGION}: sum{m in MODE_OF_OPERATION}
AverageAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[y,t,m,r] *VariableCost[y,t,m,r] = VariableOperatingCost[y,l,t,r];
```
was changed to:
```
s.t. OC1_OperatingCostsVariable{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}: sum{m in MODE_OF_OPERATION}
TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[y,t,m,r]*VariableCost[y,t,m,r] = AnnualVariableOperatingCost[y,t,r];

s.t. OC2_OperatingCostsVariableAnnual{y in YEAR,t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}: sum {l in TIMESLICE} VariableOperatingCost[y,l,t,r] = AnnualVariableOperatingCost[y,t,r]; is now deleted and the numbering is updated and changed.
 ```

New numbering and code is as follows
```
s.t. OC1_OperatingCostsVariable{y in YEAR,l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in
REGION}: sum{m in MODE_OF_OPERATION}
TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[y,t,m,r]*VariableCost[y,t,m,r] =
AnnualVariableOperatingCost[y,t,r];

s.t. OC2_OperatingCostsFixedAnnual{y in YEAR,t in TECHNOLOGY, r in REGION}:
TotalCapacityAnnual[y,t,r]*FixedCost[y,t,r] = AnnualFixedOperatingCost[y,t,r];

s.t. OC3_OperatingCostsTotalAnnual{y in YEAR,t in TECHNOLOGY,r in REGION}: AnnualFixedOperatingCost[y,t,r]+AnnualVariableOperatingCost[y,t,r] = OperatingCost[y,t,r];

s.t. OC4_DiscountedOperatingCostsTotalAnnual{y in YEAR, t in TECHNOLOGY, r in
REGION}: OperatingCost[y,t,r]/((1+DiscountRate[t,r])^(y-StartYear+0.5)) =
DiscountedOperatingCost[y,t,r];
```

(2)	Also,changed:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`AverageAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode` for `TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode` in all code.

(3)	Corrected equation Acc3 from:
```
s.t. Acc3_AverageAnnualRateOfActivity{y in YEAR,l in TIMESLICE, t in TECHNOLOGY, m in MODE_OF_OPERATION, r in REGION}: RateOfActivity[y,l,t,m,r]*YearSplit[y,l] = AverageAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[y,t,m,r];
 ```
to:
```
s.t. Acc3_AverageAnnualRateOfActivity{y in YEAR,t in TECHNOLOGY, m in
MODE_OF_OPERATION, r in REGION}: sum{l in TIMESLICE}
RateOfActivity[y,l,t,m,r]*YearSplit[y,l] =
TotalAnnualTechnologyActivityByMode[y,t,m,r];
```
